# Releaser Development

- [pyTooling/pyAttributes](https://github.com/pyTooling/pyAttributes) or
  [willmcgugan/rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) might be used to enhance the UX.

- It might be desirable to have pyTooling.Version.SemVersion handle the regular expression from
  [semver.org](https://semver.org/#is-there-a-suggested-regular-expression-regex-to-check-a-semver-string), and use
  proper Python classes in **Releaser**.
